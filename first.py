#Unpacking
#If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

#If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

a = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  a = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + a)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + a)
